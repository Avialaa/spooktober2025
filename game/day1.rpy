    "Done!"
    "The new system will take some getting used to. Until now, I've had to carry everything by hand. The boss always knew which boxes were mine because of the slime stains. I can say goodbye to that."

    A "…"
    MC "Hi, Agatha."
    A "Good afternoon, MC! Did you sleep well?"
    MC "Same as always?"
    A "Excellent!"
    A "I was hoping to hear your thoughts on the new dispatch ecosystem. After testing the fruits of the wizard's innovation all morning, I'm sure you have some solid constructive feedback."

    menu:
        "“It's more work than before.”":
            A "…While I'm sure the boss appreciates all feedback… Maybe that's a bit… But of course, I don't want to put words in your mouth! But…"
            "She looks conflicted."
        "“It's easy.”":
            A "Great! As expected of the second best employee of the year!"
            "If I recall, she came in first. I don't think she meant ill with that."

    A "I'm sure you're aware, but the boss is relying on us. That he has left us unsupervised signifies great trust."
    A "GREAT trust."
    A "Let's show up properly this week, and be the best versions of ourselves!"
    "She flutters back into the warehouse."
    "Well, the lunch hour's wasting. Not that it's ever an hour, but 30 minutes. Presently, only 28 remain."



# scene bg_corridor
# "Huh? That's…"
# # Show K sprite. Silmät kiinni?
# "He's sitting down. I can feel his snoring through the rock floor."
# # K neutral sprite
# K "…mornin', MC."
# MC "Hey Karkhos. Have you been sleeping here the entire shift?"
# K "...'course not. Stuffed them boxes real hard ‘n proper. Just like you."
# K "Man, the new system's really got me down. Learning new stuff sucks, doesn't it?"

# menu:
# ""I wouldn't go that far.""
# K "Hah! You're so easygoing.
# ""It is what it is.""
# "He perks up."
# K "So you hate it too, huh?"

# K "How come the boss isn't here to test the new system with us? I heard he went to mountaintown. They're having a festival."
# MC "He's getting us a loot deal with the mountain giants. It'll be good for the warehouse."
# K "Yeah yeah, we'll send better loot to the monsters, the monsters toss the Loot at attacking humans, and get to keep their sorry lives. The cycle of Loot that powers itself. Except in truth it's us powering it."
# K "If I work any harder than this, my stitches are gonna rip. You know how it is for zombies."
# K "Wormy has also had enough."
# #worm sprite
# "I nod as a greeting to Wormy, who returns the gesture."
# MC "I'm headed to lunch. You want to come?"
# K "Nah. Cool seeing you."
# K "…"
# "He gives me a weird look. His gaze follows me out."
# "Does he usually speak this much?"

# scene bg_breakroom
# "Because of the delays, when I reach the breakroom, I'm not the first one."
# # C happy sprite
# C "Top of the morning, fellow prisoner."
# MC "Good morning to you too, Cee."
# "Cee grimaces. It makes their face squish like putty. Goo oozes from the folds."
# C "Have you managed to feast your eyeballs on the devastation in the warehouse? The infernal machinery has been wound up, and no longer is there any stopping it."
# MC "Everyone seems to have a strong opinion on the new system."
# C "Are we, the four heralds of this abysmal lair, content with only trimming the moss, whilst the rock remains unmoved? It's about the rock, MC, the rock."
# MC "Um… The wall moss does need a trim, doesn't it?"
# # Fluttering sound
# # Agatha appears
# # C and A angry

# C "I arrived first. Begone."
# A "This is EVERYONE'S break room, as you know and have known since: forever."
# # Footsteps
# # K neutral sprite
# K "Whoa! What's good, slackers."
# "Agatha looks ready to pop a wing muscle."
# C "This is the sacredly ordained lunch break. Was it not you who slacked off? Perhaps your sacred right ought to be revoked."
# A "You can't revoke the policy mandated lunch break!"
# "They're really getting fired up. Maybe all this time, they just pretended to like each other because Boss was here. Doesn't feel like much of a break when the noise level is this high."
# "Well, not gonna ruin my day. As long as they're leaving me out of it."
# # A smile
# A "What's your stance, MC?"
# # C smile
# C "Yes, do join and settle this petty dispute of Fools."
# # K neutral
# K "..did you just call yourself…"
# MC "No, no. I'm okay with whatever you decide."
# # C neutral
# C "Nay! You must not remain impartial."
# MC "I really don't mind. I'm not even involved."
# K "Wow. I wouldn't have thought you'd stoop so low."
# MC "...wait, what?"
# C "Oh MC, you must know…"
# A "...that the only thing separating us from lowly humans is…"
# # all angry
# All "...DEMOCRACY!"
# "The declaration echoes in the room."
# # all neutral
# K "It's just the four of us working here. No hierarchies, just equals. Makes only sense we all participate in decision making."
# A "It's not a democratic decision if one of us abstains from voting."
# Mc "Can't abstinence also be a type of choice?"
# # all angry
# All "No!"
# "Suddenly they all agree an awful lot."
# # A smiles
# A "I'm afraid that's three against one."
# A "I've always said we need to work harder. This is our chance to earn the Boss' unwavering trust. Our efforts will guarantee monsters across the land safety."
# K "Nah, we should take it easy while the Boss isn't looking. Rested workers are harder workers."
# C "Why stop at puny course changes such as those? I propose we invest this time on R&D, on futureproofing this nigh obsolete lair."
# MC "Did I get this right: you need me to say who I agree with, as a tiebreaker?"
# # all smile
# "Oh dear. When I heard Boss is leaving on a business trip, I expected a more relaxed workweek. This is the opposite of that! Without asking, they roped me into their conflict, and even outvoted my attempt to get out."
# "I let out a heavy sigh. Let them see my inconvenience and suffering. I hope they feel at least a little bad."
# # all sprites smiling
# All "..."
# "I sigh deeply."
# "The quickest way out would be to give an answer."

# # tää valinta märää, onks seuraava kohtaus 1.3 A, B vai C. Mut se kohtaus tulee vast kun tää nykyinen on loppunu.
# menu:
# "Working hard is important" (agree with Agatha)
# "Before I speak, I lock eyes with Agatha. Her smile widens."
# "Enough rest is important" (agree with Karkhos)
# "Before I speak, I glance at Karkhos. Our eyes meet. Awkward."
# "Seeking new ways to improve is important" (agree with Cee)
# "Before I speak, my eyes meet Cee's. He looks surprised."
# A
# MC "I guess since I have to say, I would…"
# A "Stop!"
# MC "Why???"
# C "We cannot be appeased with mere words."
# K "Words are cheap. We need actions."
# A "What we propose goes like this: just test the system, work like you would normally. Though you claim you don't mind who wins, I wonder, is that really true?"
# K "When you work long enough at a place, it's inevitable to start forming opinions."
# A "Exactly. Just test the system, and your true feelings on this issue will surely shine through."
# "What can I even say? The fight has been beaten out of me. I'm starting to question everything I held true. Maybe being noncommittal IS unforgivable. The power of being outvoted sure is frightening."
# MC "Okay. I promise to give it some thought. If that's everything, I still need to eat."
# "They scatter, but keep giving me secretive glances."
